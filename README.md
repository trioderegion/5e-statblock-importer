# 5e-statblock-importer (Symbaroum RoS 5e Edition)
A module for the FoundryVTT **DND5e - Fifth Edition System**. Easily import 5e monster and NPC statblocks into your game from the Ruins of Symbaroum 5e conversion. As long as it's formatted using the standard WotC layout, it'll create a new actor with an NPC character sheet using those stats.

## How to use
Once installed, you'll see a new button at the bottom of the characters tab that looks like this...

Clicking the button will open a window with a big text box that you can past the statblock into. Here's an example of one for a Glabrezu from the [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

After you've pasted it in, click the "Import" button and you'll see a new actor appear in the side panel.

Open the character sheet for that new actor and you'll see all of the stats, actions, and spells filled out for you. Everything in the statblock should be represented on the character sheet, including legendary actions and reactions (which the Glabrezu doesn't have). To have the spells show up in the Spellbook requires having the "Spells (SRD)" compendium installed, which should come with the 5e system.
